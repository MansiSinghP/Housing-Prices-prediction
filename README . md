MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT- PREDICTING HOUSE PRICES

Machine learning in python-predicting housing prices
 

Introduction

In this project, we will develop and evaluate the performance and the predictive power of a model trained and tested on housing prices data.

In this step we are going to load the housing price data from CSV file URL.

1.    Import libraries

First, letâ€™s import all of the modules, functions and objects we are going to use .






2.    loading the data set

Using read_csv from pandas,we will load the dataset.








3.    Dimensions and statistical summary of dataset




 

OUTPUT-







4. Exploratory Data Analysis

Box and Whiskers plot,correlation matrix,Scatterplot and Histograms




OUTPUT-













5. Create a Validation Dataset

The dataset is now split into two, 80% of which we will use to train, evaluate and select among our models, and 20% that we will hold back as a validation dataset.




6. Developing Models

Now we will test our dataset using 6 different algorithms:

Logistic Regression (LR)
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Classification and Regression Trees (CART)
Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB)
Support Vector Machines (SVM)



OUTPUT-




 we can see that it looks like Classification and regression trees (CART) has the largest estimated accuracy score at about 0.868 or 86.8%.

7. SELECT BEST MODEL

 We need to compare the models to each other and select the most accurate.

8. Make Predictions

We must choose an algorithm to use to make predictions.

The results in the previous section suggest that the Decision Tree classifier was  the most accurate model. We will use this model as our final model.




 

OUTPUT-
